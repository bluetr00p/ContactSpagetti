# ContactSpagetti
ContactSpagetti is a python program that cleans up excess contacts from contact exports. ContactSpagetti puts them into vCard 3.0 format and also combines them into a single contact file


## How to use
1. Create the import folder and name it `import`
2. Copy the contacts into `import` folder
3. Run fix.py with python 3 `python3 fix.py`
4. Profit!! SuperContact.vcf now contains all the contacts plus they are now in vCard 3.0 format
